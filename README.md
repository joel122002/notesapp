# notesapp
This app was intended to store notes taken by a  user. It allows a user to pin, unpin, update, create and delete a note. Pinned notes are kept as permanent notification till it is manually dismissed. This app uses a local as well as an online database and we keep both the databases in sync. For the backend we use Back4App and for the local database we use SQLite.
